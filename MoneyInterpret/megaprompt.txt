This are some sample lines from Stockyards Bank transaction export.  They are not necessarily contiguous: 

Account Number,Post Date,Check,Description,Debit,Credit,Status,Balance
"XXXXXXX271",4/9/2025,,"297445 PURCHASE-SIG INTUIT *TURBOTAX CL.INTUIT.COM CA 67224506 297445",363.68,,Posted,2352.05

separate file for HELOC account also from Stockyards Bank: 

Account Number,Post Date,Check,Description,Debit,Credit,Status
"XXXXXXX040",4/4/2025,," Interest: $352.78; Extra Principal: $1451.27",,1804.05,Posted
"XXXXXXX040",3/11/2025,," Principal Advance: $500.00",500.00,,Posted

When i withdraw from HELOC, i get "pricipal advance" in the 040 account and i get the description in the 271 account (Will, $500, 3/11/2025)
When i pay the HELOC from 271, I get "Internet transfer to xxx1040" for the amount, but on the HELOC i get the description of how much is interest and how much is principal.  There is not a separate interest transaction line in the HELOC file. 

Write me a WPF app C# .net framework 8 which: 
* has a button for loading files from stockyards bank (multi select .CSV)
* stores this information in memory, does not save it, user has to reselect files when the run the program again
* has a datagrid with filters to show this information that is in memory
* has additional buttons to do transforms / matching 
** match up the withdrawals from HELOC/CLOC with the corresponding side in the family account to get the purpose of the withdrawal
** match up the payments to the HELOC/CLOC so that we get one transaction for the interest and another transaction for the principal
*** dropdown of debt account and dropdown choice of family account defaulted to 271

a generate graph button (with an account selector and date range inputs and methodology selector)
I want a less-pretty, more detailed graph of: 
* Time is horizontal axis by days
* Debt is the vertical axis
* its similar to a stacked bar chart with lots of vertical bars and no spacing between the bars
* for taking out money (040 to 271), we get a color specific to that withdrawal (and its added to the legend)
* when interest accumulates, it accumulates in an "interest" stack
* when a payment is made, it decreases based on methodology:   
** FIFO, or
** Equally applying to all current stacks, or 
** Proportionally applying to all current stacks
* the graph is shown in a new window that could be maximized
* use small but readable fonts 
* use a formula for spreading color out across a color wheel.  Primarily use hue, but also saturation.
