CsvImportService.cs MoneyInterpret When reading in files, it should compare what its reading in with what has already been read and avoid duplicates.  A duplicate checking should be implemented at the Transaction.cs level and would include all fields including the balance, which is a great way to have two transactions coming in on the same day which look identical. Transaction.cs MainWindow.xaml.cs MainViewModel.cs 

RESULT: 

These changes implement:

A Transaction class with proper equality comparison that considers all fields, including Balance
An updated CsvImportService that can filter out duplicates when importing
A modified MainWindow that tracks and reports on duplicates that were skipped during import
The implementation ensures that transactions with identical fields (including Balance) are considered duplicates and won't be added multiple times when importing CSV files.
